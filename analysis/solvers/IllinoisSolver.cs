	/// <summary>
	/// Implements the <em>Illinois</em> method for root-finding (approximating
	/// a zero of a univariate real function). It is a modified
	/// <seealso cref="RegulaFalsiSolver <em>Regula Falsi</em>"/> method.
	/// 
	/// <p>Like the <em>Regula Falsi</em> method, convergence is guaranteed by
	/// maintaining a bracketed solution. The <em>Illinois</em> method however,
	/// should converge much faster than the original <em>Regula Falsi</em>
	/// method. Furthermore, this implementation of the <em>Illinois</em> method
	/// should not suffer from the same implementation issues as the <em>Regula
	/// Falsi</em> method, which may fail to convergence in certain cases.</p>
	/// 
	/// <p>The <em>Illinois</em> method assumes that the function is continuous,
	/// but not necessarily smooth.</p>
	/// 
	/// <p>Implementation based on the following article: M. Dowell and P. Jarratt,
	/// <em>A modified regula falsi method for computing the root of an
	/// equation</em>, BIT Numerical Mathematics, volume 11, number 2,
	/// pages 168-174, Springer, 1971.</p>
