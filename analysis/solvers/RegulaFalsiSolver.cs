	/// <summary>
	/// Implements the <em>Regula Falsi</em> or <em>False position</em> method for
	/// root-finding (approximating a zero of a univariate real function). It is a
	/// modified <seealso cref="SecantSolver <em>Secant</em>"/> method.
	/// 
	/// <p>The <em>Regula Falsi</em> method is included for completeness, for
	/// testing purposes, for educational purposes, for comparison to other
	/// algorithms, etc. It is however <strong>not</strong> intended to be used
	/// for actual problems, as one of the bounds often remains fixed, resulting
	/// in very slow convergence. Instead, one of the well-known modified
	/// <em>Regula Falsi</em> algorithms can be used ({@link IllinoisSolver
	/// <em>Illinois</em>} or <seealso cref="PegasusSolver <em>Pegasus</em>"/>). These two
	/// algorithms solve the fundamental issues of the original <em>Regula
	/// Falsi</em> algorithm, and greatly out-performs it for most, if not all,
	/// (practical) functions.
	/// 
	/// <p>Unlike the <em>Secant</em> method, the <em>Regula Falsi</em> guarantees
	/// convergence, by maintaining a bracketed solution. Note however, that due to
	/// the finite/limited precision of Java's <seealso cref="Double double"/> type, which is
	/// used in this implementation, the algorithm may get stuck in a situation
	/// where it no longer makes any progress. Such cases are detected and result
	/// in a {@code ConvergenceException} exception being thrown. In other words,
	/// the algorithm theoretically guarantees convergence, but the implementation
	/// does not.</p>
	/// 
	/// <p>The <em>Regula Falsi</em> method assumes that the function is continuous,
	/// but not necessarily smooth.</p>
	/// 
	/// <p>Implementation based on the following article: M. Dowell and P. Jarratt,
	/// <em>A modified regula falsi method for computing the root of an
	/// equation</em>, BIT Numerical Mathematics, volume 11, number 2,
	/// pages 168-174, Springer, 1971.</p>
